				<div id="story-excerpt">
					<p>The first Donut Hole opened in 1963, in La Puente, California. According to one source, the shop in La Puente was the second to open, in 1968, and was followed by three others. However, various sources disagree and date the building's original construction from 1947[3] to 1958[4] to 1962.What is certain is that the donut chain went out of business in 1979. The LaPuente donut hole was purchased by the Lopez family in 1979 and remained in the family until 2003. The Covina branch was completely remodeled and the others were demolished, and only the La Puente location remains today as a working bakery. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Donut_Hole#:~:text=The%20Donut%20Hole%20is%20a,shops%20in%20the%20United%20States.">Read more about our story here.</a></p>

							<p> Yay for National Donut Day! While this glorious day of celebration will forever be marked in our calendar, let’s address the elephant in the room: Donuts are among the worst foods you can eat. The fat count reaches a whopping 10 to 20 grams per donut, which can cause depression and take a serious toll on your waistline. BUT let’s be honest: Everyone deserves a treat once in awhile, and donuts are just. SO. GOOD.<a href="https://www.rd.com/article/history-of-doughtnuts/">Read more &rarr;</a></p>
